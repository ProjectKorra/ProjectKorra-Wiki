Elements and Abilities
======================
Each of the elements and chiblocking have various abilities which
can be used for combat, exploration, and resource gathering.

Airbending
==========
Air is the element of freedom. Airbenders are quick, agile, and
passive in nature, preferring to bob and weave through flurries of
attacks, and defending if they have no other option.

Airbending abilities tend to focus on movement and speed, but also
have a variety of combat techniques.

Earthbending
============
Earth is the element of substance. Earthbenders stay rooted to the
ground, preferring to face opponents head-on, using a mix of
defensive and offensive strategies to crush their foes.

while remaining on the ground when possible.

powerful, choosing to overwhelm their opponents with an endless
onslaught of offensive attacks instead of being defensive.

Waterbending
============
Water is the element of change. Waterbenders use their plethora of
skills to redirect and manipulate opponents attacks against them.
Similar to Earthbenders, they employ both defensive and offensive
strategies to accomplish this.

Waterbending abilities focus on being able to adapt between offense, defense, and mobility.

Chiblocking
===========
Chiblocking is the anti-bending fighting style. Chiblockers use critically
placed kicks and punches to block chi paths in bender's bodies, doing
anything from disabling their bending to temporarily paralyzing
them.

Chiblocking abilities are purely for combat, being able to temporarily block a bender's chi so they are unable to bend.
