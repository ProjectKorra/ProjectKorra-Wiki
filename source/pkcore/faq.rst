What Spigot version does the current plugin version support?
============================================================

ProjectKorra Core **v1.8.8** is compatible with Spigot **1.13.2** at the moment.

If it still is not operating properly, consider that your Spigot version may not be fully up to date. Spigot **1.13.2** alone has over **400** updates to it. You can check the status of your version by executing the ``/version`` command while on your server. If you are not up to date, try getting an updated Spigot ``.jar`` file. You can achieve this by building the latest version with Build Tools.

How can I report a bug?
=======================

ProjectKorra Core bugs can be reported `here <https://projectkorra.com/forum/forums/core-support.67/>`_.

As of ProjectKorra Core v1.5.0, there is a debug feature built into the plugin.
This will help us a ton when you submit a bug report if you include the debug.txt
created when you use the /bending debug command in addition to a log of your console
if it shows a visible error. Debug will help us by listing ProjectKorra plugins and
dependencies so that we can isolate the source of the problem. This speeds up the
bug fixing process A LOT.
