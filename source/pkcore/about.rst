About Core
==========

ProjectKorra Core is an open source Spigot plugin, created by MistPhizzle
in June 2014, based on Orion's original *Minecraft: The Last
Airbender* plugin for Bukkit. ProjectKorra's purpose is to bring the
*Avatar: The Last Airbender* and *Avatar: The Legend of Korra* universe
into Minecraft, allowing players to choose between the skills shown in
the show: Firebending, Airbending, Waterbending, Earthbending, or Chiblocking.

Features
========

`ProjectKorra Core`_ is a plugin based off of the bending universe, thus
so there must be bending! As stated above, players can choose from 5 skills:
Fire, Air, Water, Earth, or Chi. Each of the skills has its own playstyle, so it's up to the player to find the
one that suits them.

Elements
--------

-  Air is the element of freedom. Airbenders are quick, agile, and
   passive in nature, preferring to bob and weave through flurries of
   attacks, and defending if they have no other option.

-  Fire is the element of power. Firebenders are very aggressive and
   powerful, choosing to overwhelm their opponents with an endless
   onslaught of offensive attacks instead of being defensive.

-  Earth is the element of substance. Earthbenders stay rooted to the
   ground, preferring to face opponents head-on, using a mix of
   defensive and offensive strategies to crush their foes.

-  Water is the element of change. Waterbenders use their plethora of
   skills to redirect and manipulate opponents attacks against them.
   Similar to Earthbenders, they employ both defensive and offensive
   strategies to accomplish this.

-  Chi is the anti-bending fighting style. Chiblockers use well placed blows to 
   temporarily disable their opponents bending, leaving them virtually defenseless.
