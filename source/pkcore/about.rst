==========
About Core
==========

ProjectKorra Core is an open source Spigot plugin, established by MistPhizzle
in June 2014, based upon Orion's original *Minecraft: The Last
Airbender* plugin for Bukkit. ProjectKorra's purpose is to bring the
*Avatar: The Last Airbender* and *Avatar: The Legend of Korra* universe
into Minecraft, allowing players to choose between the skills shown in
the show: Fire, Air, Water, Earth, and Chiblocking.

Features
========

`ProjectKorra Core`_ is a plugin based off of the bending universe, thus
so there must be bending! Players can choose from 5 skills: Fire, Air,
Water, Earth, and Chiblocking. Each element has its own respective playstyle, so
it's up to the player to find the one that suits them the most.

Elements
--------

-  Air is the element of freedom. Airbenders are quick, agile, and
   passive in nature, preferring to bob and weave through flurries of
   attacks, and defending if they have no other option.

-  Fire is the element of power. Firebenders are very aggressive and
   powerful, choosing to overwhelm their opponents with an endless
   onslaught of offensive attacks instead of being defensive.

-  Earth is the element of substance. Earthbenders stay rooted to the
   ground, preferring to face opponents head-on, using a mix of
   defensive and offensive strategies to crush their foes.

-  Water is the element of change. Waterbenders use their plethora of
   skills to redirect and manipulate opponents attacks against them.
   Similar to Earthbenders, they employ both defensive and offensive
   strategies to accomplish this.

-  Chi is the life energy that flows through everything. Humans, along
   with some animals, learned how to control the chi inside them to
   resonate with some element in the world, but even more powerful is
   the ability to manipulate the chi itself. Chiblocking is a fighting
   style which uses precises strikes to disrupt the flow of chi, disabling
   someone's bending temporarily.
