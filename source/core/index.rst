Introduction
==============
ProjectKorra Core is an open source Spigot plugin, established by MistPhizzle
in June 2014, based upon Orion's original *Minecraft: The Last
Airbender* plugin for Bukkit. 

ProjectKorra Core's purpose is to bring the
*Avatar: The Last Airbender* and *Avatar: The Legend of Korra* universes
into Minecraft, allowing players to choose between the skills shown in
the show: Fire, Air, Water, Earth, and Chi.

Features
==========
`ProjectKorra Core`_ is a plugin based off of the bending universe. 
Players can choose from 5 skills: Fire, Air,
Water, Earth, and Chi. Each element has its own respective playstyle, so
it's up to the player to find the one that suits them the most.

-  Air is the element of freedom. Airbenders are quick, agile, and
   passive in nature, preferring to bob and weave through flurries of
   attacks, and defending if they have no other option.

-  Fire is the element of power. Firebenders are very aggressive and
   powerful, choosing to overwhelm their opponents with an endless
   onslaught of offensive attacks instead of being defensive.

-  Earth is the element of substance. Earthbenders stay rooted to the
   ground, preferring to face opponents head-on, using a mix of
   defensive and offensive strategies to crush their foes.

-  Water is the element of change. Waterbenders use their plethora of
   skills to redirect and manipulate opponents attacks against them.
   Similar to Earthbenders, they employ both defensive and offensive
   strategies to accomplish this.

-  Chi is the anti-bending fighting style. Chiblockers use critically
   placed kicks and punches to block chi paths in bender's bodies, doing
   anything from preventing them from bending to temporarily paralyzing
   them.
