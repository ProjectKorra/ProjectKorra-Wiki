What is ProjectKorra?
=====================

ProjectKorra is an open source Spigot plugin, established by MistPhizzle
in June 2014, based upon Orion's original *Minecraft: The Last
Airbender* plugin for Bukkit. ProjectKorra's purpose is to bring the
*Avatar: The Last Airbender* and *Avatar: The Legend of Korra* universe
into Minecraft, allowing players to choose between the skills shown in
the show: Fire, Air, Water, Earth, and Chi.

Features
========

`ProjectKorra Core`_ is a plugin based off of the bending universe, thus
so there must be bending! Players can choose from 5 skills: Fire, Air,
Water, Earth, and Chi. Each element has its own respective playstyle, so
it's up to the player to find the one that suits them the most.

-  Air is the element of freedom. Airbenders are quick, agile, and
   passive in nature, preferring to bob and weave through flurries of
   attacks, and defending if they have no other option.

-  Fire is the element of power. Firebenders are very aggressive and
   powerful, choosing to overwhelm their opponents with an endless
   onslaught of offensive attacks instead of being defensive.

-  Earth is the element of substance. Earthbenders stay rooted to the
   ground, preferring to face opponents head-on, using a mix of
   defensive and offensive strategies to crush their foes.

-  Water is the element of change. Waterbenders use their plethora of
   skills to redirect and manipulate opponents attacks against them.
   Similar to Earthbenders, they employ both defensive and offensive
   strategies to accomplish this.

-  Chi is the anti-bending fighting style. Chiblockers use critically
   placed kicks and punches to block chi paths in bender's bodies, doing
   anything from preventing them from bending to temporarily paralyzing
   them.

FAQ
===

Who runs ProjectKorra?
----------------------

There is a volunteer staff team that helps maintain ProjectKorra: from developers and digital media people, to server admins and moderators! Despite the staff team however, ProjectKorra heavily relies on its community and would not successful without it.

How can I get involved with ProjectKorra?
-----------------------------------------

Absolutely anyone can become involved with ProjectKorra. We have many departments that we would love for people to be involved in, such as Development, Moderation, Server Building, or Digital Team. Apply by clicking `here <https://projectkorra.com/join-the-team/>`_!

What Spigot version does the current plugin version support?
------------------------------------------------------------

ProjectKorra (CORE) **v1.8.8** is compatible with Spigot **1.13.2** at the moment.

How can I report a bug?
-----------------------

We encourage all bugs, big and small, be reported in the proper bug report section of the forum. Please report all bugs `here <https://projectkorra.com/forum/categories/help-and-support.91/>`_. If fixable, all bugs are fixed ASAP. As of ProjectKorra(CORE) v1.5.0, there is a debug feature built into the plugin. This will help us a ton when you submit a bug report if you include the debug.txt created when you use the /bending debug command in addition to a log of your console if it shows a visible error. Debug will help us by listing ProjectKorra plugins and dependencies so that we can isolate the source of the problem. This speeds up the bug fixing process A LOT.

How can I suggest a feature?
----------------------------

As said before, we wouldn't be here today if it weren't for the community, so we absolutely encourage members to suggest features! Suggestions do not have to be based off of something you had seen in the show, rather, they must remain practical. You can make suggestions by clicking `here <https://projectkorra.com/forum/forums/suggestions.8/>`_. Please ensure that your suggestion has not been suggested a million other times and it does not already exist.
