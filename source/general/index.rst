FAQ
===

Who runs ProjectKorra?
----------------------

There is a volunteer staff team that helps maintain ProjectKorra: from developers and digital media people, to server admins and moderators! Despite the staff team however, ProjectKorra heavily relies on its community and would not successful without it.

How can I get involved with ProjectKorra?
-----------------------------------------

Absolutely anyone can become involved with ProjectKorra. We have many departments that we would love for people to be involved in, such as Development, Moderation, Server Building, or Digital Team. Apply by clicking `here <https://projectkorra.com/join-the-team/>`_!

What Spigot version does the current plugin version support?
------------------------------------------------------------

ProjectKorra (CORE) **v1.8.8** is compatible with Spigot **1.13.2** at the moment.

How can I report a bug?
-----------------------

We encourage all bugs, big and small, be reported in the proper bug report section of the forum. Please report all bugs `here <https://projectkorra.com/forum/categories/help-and-support.91/>`_. If fixable, all bugs are fixed ASAP. As of ProjectKorra(CORE) v1.5.0, there is a debug feature built into the plugin. This will help us a ton when you submit a bug report if you include the debug.txt created when you use the /bending debug command in addition to a log of your console if it shows a visible error. Debug will help us by listing ProjectKorra plugins and dependencies so that we can isolate the source of the problem. This speeds up the bug fixing process A LOT.

How can I suggest a feature?
----------------------------

As said before, we wouldn't be here today if it weren't for the community, so we absolutely encourage members to suggest features! Suggestions do not have to be based off of something you had seen in the show, rather, they must remain practical. You can make suggestions by clicking `here <https://projectkorra.com/forum/forums/suggestions.8/>`_. Please ensure that your suggestion has not been suggested a million other times and it does not already exist.
