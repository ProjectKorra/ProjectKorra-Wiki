Does ProjectKorra work for X version?
================================

ProjectKorra's latest release, 1.9.0, was designed for Spigot 1.16.

How do I install ProjectKorra on my server?
===========================================

First, download ProjectKorra from the link above. Then, place the .jar file you downloaded into your server's "plugins" folder. Finally, restart your server.

How do I get the bending sideboard that shows my bound abilities?
=================================================================

ProjectKorra currently doesn't come with a bending sideboard. You'd have to install a side plugin for this.
The well-known side plugins JedCore and ProjectAddons come with bending boards, but they also include a myriad of addon abilities.
The download links for both side plugins can be found below; to install them you'd download the .jar file and put it in your server's "plugins" folder.

.. note:: These side plugins are addons and are not maintained by ProjectKorra, and ProjectKorra developers may not be able to offer support with them.

`JedCore download for Minecraft 1.15/1.14 <https://github.com/plushmonkey/JedCore/releases>`_
`ProjectAddons download for Minecraft 1.16 <https://github.com/Simplicitee/ProjectAddons/releases>`_

How do I use ProjectKorra on singleplayer?
==========================================

ProjectKorra is a Spigot plugin, and plugins are intended for multiplayer servers.
You can either try the Avatar Mod 2, which is not the same as ProjectKorra, or you could make your own multiplayer server, install ProjectKorra, and just not portforward or tell others about it, basically making it a singleplayer experience.
You can download the Avatar Mod 2 `here <https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/avatar-mod-2-out-of-the-iceberg>`_.
