Where can I download ProjectKorra?
==================================

The latest release of ProjectKorra is 1.8.9, which works for Minecraft 1.15 and 1.14. You can download it `here <https://projectkorra.com/forum/resources/projectkorra-core.1/>`_.

Does ProjectKorra work for 1.16?
================================

The latest release, 1.8.9, was designed for Minecraft 1.15 and 1.14.
If you installed it on your 1.16 server, the plugin would mostly work, but it would break under certain circumstances. Therefore, it's not recommended to use PK 1.8.9 for Minecraft 1.16.
The next release will provide support for 1.16. The developers are working hard to ensure there are no game-breaking bugs before releasing, but the next update will come very soon and will add blue fire for firebenders, among other improvements.
For now, you can try to compile the work-in-progress source code `here <https://projectkorra.com/forum/resources/projectkorra-core.1/>`_.

How do I install ProjectKorra on my server?
===========================================

First, download ProjectKorra from the link above. Then, place the .jar file you downloaded into your server's "plugins" folder. Finally, restart your server.

How do I install ProjectKorra on my Aternos or Minehut server?
==============================================================

Free Minecraft hosting websites come with limitations. Your site probably prevents you from installing a plugin the manual way, right into your "plugins" folder.
If your hosting site has an automatic plugin installer, they probably detected the newest version as ProjectKorra 1.8.8 from the Spigot page, which unfortunately only works for Minecraft 1.13.
We're currently unable to post an updated version on the Spigot page, which means you can't use your host site's plugin installer to install the newest version of ProjectKorra.
For optimum customizability, we recommend the use of cheap (but not free) hosting websites or a server you host on your computer. There are many tutorials on how to set up a Minecraft server.

How do I get the bending sideboard that shows my bound abilities?
=================================================================

ProjectKorra doesn't come with a bending sideboard. You'd have to install a side plugin for this.
The well-known side plugins JedCore and ProjectAddons come with bending boards, but they also include a myriad of addon abilities.
`JedCore download for Minecraft 1.15/1.14 <https://github.com/plushmonkey/JedCore/releases>`_
`ProjectAddons download for Minecraft 1.15/1.14 <https://github.com/Simplicitee/ProjectAddons/releases>`_

How do I use ProjectKorra on singleplayer?
==========================================

ProjectKorra is a Minecraft plugin, and plugins are intended for multiplayer servers.
You can either try the Avatar 2 Mod, which is outdated and mostly unrelated to ProjectKorra, or you could make your own multiplayer server, install ProjectKorra, and just not portforward or tell others about it, basically making it a singleplayer experience.
