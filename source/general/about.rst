About ProjectKorra
==================

ProjectKorra was originally a Bukkit plugin that was updated for Spigot by MistPhizzle, a helper on the
Bukkit version. Since then ProjectKorra has grown into a team that works on various projects all based
around adapting the *Avatar: The Last Airbender* and *The Legend of Korra* universe into Minecraft.
