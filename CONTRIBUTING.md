## Contributing Guidelines
All edits, changes, and pages must be written with respect to these guidelines.
### Syntax

#### Naming Standards
* Names follow the following syntax
> 1. File names shall be written as one word (ex. `index.rst`, `pkteam.rst`)
> 2. All headers and titles shall be capitalized given general English convention. (ex. Contributing to the Wiki, Downloading ProjectKorra Core)
> 3. When referring to various plugins, only capitalize the first letter of the name unless it is an acronym. (ex. ProjectKorra Core vs ProjectKorra CORE, RPG)

#### Writing
* When referring to group entities, (ex. staff, developers, moderators) they shall be treated as a plural group. (ex. The staff are delighted to help)
> 1. ProjectKorra shall be referred as a singular entity. (ex. ProjectKorra is a broad organization)
* Avoid making general grammar mistakes. (ex. run-on sentences, isolating dependent clauses, etc)

#### ReST Syntax
* Header Syntax follows the following syntax
> 1. Titles shall be designated by two bars of '#' spanning exactly the length of the title header.
> 2. Sections shall be designated by one bar of '#' spanning exactly the length of the section header.
> 3. Sub-sections shall be designated by one bar of '-' spanning exactly the length of the sub-section header.
* Internal references shall be designated by use of the `:ref:` function.
* External references shall be designated by use of reST substitutions. (ex.``` `Python_`  .. _Python: http://www.python.org/ ```)

### General Rules

#### Content
* When referring to other content, it is generally expected that a link be included to said content. (ex. When referring to ProjectKorra staff, add a link to the staff page)
* Sentences should be short, to the point, and non-verbose.
* Ensure that there is a Trello Card/GitHub Issue before making any changes. If there is not, add one so that your modifications can be accounted for.

#### Pull Requests
* Try to make one pull request per page changed in order to prevent backlog/conflicts.
* You need two approving reviews before your changes can be merged.
